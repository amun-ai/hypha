    This test verifies the fix for a critical memory leak where HTTP requests
    would create new RedisRPCConnection objects on every request because they
    passed None as client_id, causing a new random ID to be generated each time.

    The fix uses stable client IDs for HTTP anonymous users (e.g., 'http-anon-public')
    to enable connection reuse across requests.
