# Artifact Manager

The `Artifact Manager` is a built-in Hypha service for indexing, managing, and storing resources such as datasets, AI models, and applications. It provides a structured way to manage datasets and similar resources, enabling efficient listing, uploading, updating, and deleting of files. It also now supports tracking download statistics for each artifact.

A typical use case for the `Artifact Manager` is as a backend for a single-page web application that displays a gallery of datasets, AI models, applications, or other types of resources. The default metadata of an artifact is designed to render a grid of cards on a webpage. It also supports tracking download statistics.

**Note:** The `Artifact Manager` is only available when your Hypha server has S3 storage enabled.

---

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Connecting to the Artifact Manager Service

To use the `Artifact Manager`, you first need to connect to the Hypha server. This API allows you to create, read, edit, and delete datasets in the artifact registry (stored in an S3 bucket for each workspace).

```python
from hypha_rpc.websocket_client import connect_to_server

SERVER_URL = "https://hypha.aicell.io"  # Replace with your server URL

# Connect to the Dataset Manager API
server = await connect_to_server({"name": "test-client", "server_url": SERVER_URL})
artifact_manager = await server.get_service("public/artifact-manager")
```

### Step 2: Creating a Dataset Gallery Collection

Once connected, you can create a collection to organize datasets in the gallery.

```python
# Create a collection for the Dataset Gallery
gallery_manifest = {
    "id": "dataset-gallery",
    "name": "Dataset Gallery",
    "description": "A collection for organizing datasets",
    "type": "collection",
    "collection": [],
}

await artifact_manager.create(prefix="collections/dataset-gallery", manifest=gallery_manifest)
print("Dataset Gallery created.")
```

### Step 3: Adding a Dataset to the Gallery

After creating the gallery, you can start adding datasets to it. Each dataset will have its own manifest that describes the dataset and any associated files.

```python
# Create a new dataset inside the Dataset Gallery
dataset_manifest = {
    "id": "example-dataset",
    "name": "Example Dataset",
    "description": "A dataset with example data",
    "type": "dataset",
    "files": [],
}

await artifact_manager.create(prefix="collections/dataset-gallery/example-dataset", manifest=dataset_manifest, stage=True)
print("Dataset added to the gallery.")
```

### Step 4: Uploading Files to the Dataset with Download Statistics

Once you have created a dataset, you can upload files to it by generating a pre-signed URL. This URL allows you to upload the actual files to the artifact's S3 bucket.

Additionally, when uploading files to an artifact, you can specify a `download_weight` for each file. This weight determines how the file impacts the artifact's download count when it is accessed. For example, primary files might have a higher `download_weight`, while secondary files might have no impact. The download count is automatically updated whenever users download files from the artifact.

```python
# Get a pre-signed URL to upload a file, with a download_weight assigned
put_url = await artifact_manager.put_file(prefix="collections/dataset-gallery/example-dataset", file_path="data.csv", options={"download_weight": 0.5})

# Upload the file using an HTTP PUT request
with open("path/to/local/data.csv", "rb") as f:
    response = requests.put(put_url, data=f)
    assert response.ok, "File upload failed"

print("File uploaded to the dataset.")
```

### Step 5: Committing the Dataset

After uploading the files, commit the dataset to finalize it. This will check that all files have been uploaded and update the collection.

```python
# Finalize and commit the dataset
await artifact_manager.commit(prefix="collections/dataset-gallery/example-dataset")
print("Dataset committed.")
```

### Step 6: Listing All Datasets in the Gallery

You can retrieve a list of all datasets in the collection to display on a webpage or for further processing.

```python
# List all datasets in the gallery
datasets = await artifact_manager.list(prefix="collections/dataset-gallery")
print("Datasets in the gallery:", datasets)
```

## Full Example: Creating and Managing a Dataset Gallery

Here’s a full example that shows how to connect to the service, create a dataset gallery, add a dataset, upload files with download statistics, and commit the dataset.

```python
import asyncio
import requests
from hypha_rpc import connect_to_server

SERVER_URL = "https://hypha.aicell.io"

async def main():
    # Connect to the Dataset Manager API
    api = await connect_to_server({"name": "test-client", "server_url": SERVER_URL})
    artifact_manager = await api.get_service("public/artifact-manager")

    # Create a collection for the Dataset Gallery
    gallery_manifest = {
        "id": "dataset-gallery",
        "name": "Dataset Gallery",
        "description": "A collection for organizing datasets",
        "type": "collection",
        "collection": [],
    }
    await artifact_manager.create(prefix="collections/dataset-gallery", manifest=gallery_manifest)
    print("Dataset Gallery created.")

    # Create a new dataset inside the Dataset Gallery
    dataset_manifest = {
        "id": "example-dataset",
        "name": "Example Dataset",
        "description": "A dataset with example data",
        "type": "dataset",
        "files": [],
    }
    await artifact_manager.create(prefix="collections/dataset-gallery/example-dataset", manifest=dataset_manifest, stage=True)
    print("Dataset added to the gallery.")

    # Get a pre-signed URL to upload a file, with a download_weight assigned
    put_url = await artifact_manager.put_file(prefix="collections/dataset-gallery/example-dataset", file_path="data.csv", options={"download_weight": 0.5})

    # Upload the file using an HTTP PUT request
    with open("path/to/local/data.csv", "rb") as f:
        response = requests.put(put_url, data=f)
        assert response.ok, "File upload failed"
    print("File uploaded to the dataset.")

    # Finalize and commit the dataset
    await artifact_manager.commit(prefix="collections/dataset-gallery/example-dataset")
    print("Dataset committed.")

    # List all datasets in the gallery
    datasets = await artifact_manager.list(prefix="collections/dataset-gallery")
    print("Datasets in the gallery:", datasets)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Advanced Usage: Enforcing Schema for Dataset Validation

The `Artifact Manager` supports enforcing a schema to ensure that datasets conform to a specific structure. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to maintain consistency across multiple datasets.

### Step 1: Create a Collection with a Schema

You can define a schema for the collection that specifies the required fields for each dataset.

```python
# Define a schema for datasets in the gallery
dataset_schema = {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "id": {"type": "string"},
        "name": {"type": "string"},
        "description": {"type": "string"},
        "type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["dataset", "model", "application"]},
        "files": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"path": {"type": "string"}}},
        },
    },
    "required": ["id", "name", "description", "type"]
}

# Create a collection with the schema
gallery_manifest = {
    "id": "schema-dataset-gallery",
    "name": "Schema Dataset Gallery",
    "description": "A gallery of datasets with enforced schema",
    "type": "collection",
    "collection_schema": dataset_schema,
    "collection": [],
}

await artifact_manager.create(prefix="collections/schema-dataset-gallery", manifest=gallery_manifest)
print("Schema-based Dataset Gallery created.")
```

### Step 2: Validate Dataset Against Schema

When you commit a dataset to this collection, it will be validated against the schema.

```python
# Create a valid dataset that conforms to the schema
valid_dataset_manifest = {
    "id": "valid-dataset",
    "name": "Valid Dataset",
    "description": "A valid dataset conforming to the schema",
    "type": "dataset",
}

await artifact_manager.create(prefix="collections/schema-dataset-gallery/valid-dataset", manifest=valid_dataset_manifest, stage=True)
print("Valid dataset created.")

# Commit the valid dataset (this should pass schema validation)
await artifact_manager.commit(prefix="collections/schema-dataset-gallery/valid-dataset")
print("Valid dataset committed.")
```

## Example Usage of API Functions

Here's a simple sequence of API function calls to manage a dataset gallery:

```python
# Step 1: Connect to the API
server = await connect_to_server({"name": "test-client", "server_url": "https://hypha.aicell.io"})
artifact_manager = await server.get_service("public/artifact-manager")

# Step 2: Create a gallery collection
gallery_manifest = {
    "id": "dataset-gallery",
    "name": "Dataset Gallery",
    "description": "A collection for organizing datasets",
    "type": "collection",
    "collection": [],
}
await artifact_manager.create(prefix="collections/dataset-gallery", manifest=gallery_manifest)

# Step 3: Add a dataset to the gallery
dataset_manifest = {
    "id": "example-dataset",
    "name": "Example Dataset",
    "description": "A dataset with example data",
    "type": "dataset",
    "files": [],
}
await artifact_manager.create(prefix="collections/dataset-gallery/example-dataset", manifest=dataset_manifest, stage=True)

# Step 4: Upload a file to the dataset
put_url = await artifact_manager.put_file(prefix="collections/dataset-gallery/example-dataset", file_path="data.csv")
with open("path/to/local/data.csv", "rb") as f:
    response = requests.put(put_url, data=f)
    assert response.ok, "File upload failed"

# Step 5: Commit the dataset
await artifact_manager.commit(prefix="collections/dataset-gallery/example-dataset")

# Step 6: List all datasets in the gallery
datasets = await artifact_manager.list(prefix="collections/dataset-gallery")
print("Datasets in the gallery:", datasets)
```


### Resetting Download Statistics

You can reset the download statistics of a dataset using the `reset_stats` function.

```python
await artifact_manager.reset_stats(prefix="collections/dataset-gallery/example-dataset")
print("Download statistics reset.")
```

## HTTP API for Accessing Artifacts and Download Counts

The `Artifact Manager` provides an HTTP endpoint for retrieving artifact manifests, data, and download statistics. This is useful for public-facing web applications that need to access datasets, models, or applications.

### Endpoint: `/{workspace}/artifact/{path:path}`

- **Workspace**: The workspace in which the artifact is stored.
- **Path**: The relative path to the artifact.
  - For public artifacts, the path must begin with `public/`.
  - For private artifacts, the path does not include the `public/` prefix and requires proper authentication.

### Request Format:

- **Method**: `GET`
- **Headers**:
  - `Authorization`: Optional. The user's token for accessing private artifacts (obtained via the login logic or created by `api.generate_token()`). Not required for public artifacts under the `public/` prefix.
- **Parameters**:
  - `workspace`: The workspace in which the artifact is stored.
  - `path`:

 The path to the artifact (e.g., `public/collections/dataset-gallery/example-dataset`).
  - `stage` (optional): A boolean flag to indicate whether to fetch the staged version of the manifest (`_manifest.yaml`). Default is `False`.

### Response:

- **For public artifacts**: Returns the artifact manifest if it exists under the `public/` prefix, including any download statistics in the `_stats` field.
- **For private artifacts**: Returns the artifact manifest if the user has the necessary permissions.


### Example: Fetching a public artifact with download statistics

```python
import requests

SERVER_URL = "https://hypha.aicell.io"
workspace = "my-workspace"
response = requests.get(f"{SERVER_URL}/{workspace}/artifact/public/collections/dataset-gallery/example-dataset")
if response.ok:
    artifact = response.json()
    print(artifact["name"])  # Output: Example Dataset
    print(artifact["_stats"]["download_count"])  # Output: Download count for the dataset
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
```
