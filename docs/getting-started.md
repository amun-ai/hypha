# Getting Started

## Installation

To install the Hypha package, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -U hypha
```

If you need full support for server-side browser applications, use the following command instead:

```bash
pip install -U "hypha[server-apps]"
playwright install
```

## Starting the Server

To start the Hypha server, use the following command:

```bash
python3 -m hypha.server --host=0.0.0.0 --port=9527
```

### Starting with Built-in S3 (Minio) Server

For features requiring S3 object storage (like Server Apps or Artifact Management), Hypha provides a convenient built-in Minio server. To start the Hypha server along with this built-in S3 server, use the `--start-minio-server` flag:

```bash
python3 -m hypha.server --host=0.0.0.0 --port=9527 --start-minio-server
```

This automatically:
- Starts a Minio server process.
- Enables S3 support (`--enable-s3`).
- Configures the necessary S3 connection details (`--endpoint-url`, `--access-key-id`, `--secret-access-key`).

**Note:** You cannot use `--start-minio-server` if you are also manually providing S3 connection details (e.g., `--endpoint-url`). Choose one method or the other.

You can customize the built-in Minio server using these options:
- `--minio-workdir`: Specify a directory for Minio data (defaults to a temporary directory).
- `--minio-port`: Set the port for the Minio server (defaults to 9000).
- `--minio-root-user`: Set the root user (defaults to `minioadmin`).
- `--minio-root-password`: Set the root password (defaults to `minioadmin`).
- `--minio-version`: Specify a specific version of the Minio server to use.
- `--mc-version`: Specify a specific version of the Minio client to use.
- `--minio-file-system-mode`: Enable file system mode with specific compatible versions.

Example with custom Minio settings:
```bash
python3 -m hypha.server --host=0.0.0.0 --port=9527 \
    --start-minio-server \
    --minio-workdir=./minio_data \
    --minio-port=9001 \
    --minio-root-user=myuser \
    --minio-root-password=mypassword
```

#### Minio File System Mode

For better filesystem-like behavior, you can enable file system mode with the `--minio-file-system-mode` flag:

```bash
python3 -m hypha.server --host=0.0.0.0 --port=9527 \
    --start-minio-server \
    --minio-file-system-mode
```

When file system mode is enabled, Hypha uses specific versions of Minio that are compatible with file system operations:
- Minio server: `RELEASE.2022-10-24T18-35-07Z`
- Minio client: `RELEASE.2022-10-29T10-09-23Z`

This mode optimizes Minio for use as a direct file system, which means:
1. Files are stored in their raw format, allowing direct access from the file system
2. The .minio.sys directory is automatically cleaned up to avoid version conflicts
3. The Minio server process is properly terminated when the application shuts down

File system mode is particularly useful for development environments and when you need to access the stored files directly without using S3 API calls.

**Note:** In file system mode, some advanced S3 features like versioning may not be available, but basic operations like storing and retrieving files will work consistently.

#### Running with Built-in S3 (Minio) in Docker

When running Hypha with the built-in Minio server inside a Docker container, additional considerations are necessary:

1. **Volume Mounting**: For data persistence, mount a volume for the Minio data directory:
   ```bash
   docker run -v /host/path/to/minio_data:/app/minio_data your-hypha-image \
     python -m hypha.server --host=0.0.0.0 --port=9527 \
     --start-minio-server \
     --minio-workdir=/app/minio_data
   ```

2. **Executable Path**: You may need to specify the Minio executable path with `--executable-path`:
   ```bash
   docker run your-hypha-image \
     python -m hypha.server --host=0.0.0.0 --port=9527 \
     --start-minio-server \
     --executable-path=/path/to/minio
   ```

3. **Permissions**: Ensure the Minio working directory is writable by the container user:
   ```bash
   docker run -v /host/path/to/minio_data:/app/minio_data your-hypha-image \
     chown -R container_user:container_user /app/minio_data && \
     python -m hypha.server --host=0.0.0.0 --port=9527 \
     --start-minio-server \
     --minio-workdir=/app/minio_data
   ```

4. **Port Exposure**: Remember to expose both the Hypha port and Minio port:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 9527:9527 -p 9000:9000 -v /host/path/to/minio_data:/app/minio_data your-hypha-image \
     python -m hypha.server --host=0.0.0.0 --port=9527 \
     --start-minio-server
   ```

### Starting with Server Apps

If you want to enable server apps (browsers running on the server side), you need to enable S3 storage first. You can either configure an external S3 provider or use the built-in Minio server as described above. 

To start with server apps enabled, use the `--enable-server-apps` flag along with your S3 configuration method:

Using built-in Minio:
```bash
python -m hypha.server --host=0.0.0.0 --port=9527 --start-minio-server --enable-server-apps
```

Using external S3 (example):
```bash
python -m hypha.server --host=0.0.0.0 --port=9527 \
    --enable-s3 \
    --endpoint-url=<your-s3-endpoint> \
    --access-key-id=<your-key-id> \
    --secret-access-key=<your-secret> \
    --enable-server-apps
```

You can test if the server is running by visiting [http://localhost:9527](http://localhost:9527) and checking the Hypha server version.

You can also start the server as a uvicorn server by running:
```bash
# arguments are passed in the environment variables, e.g. HYPHA_ENABLE_SERVER_APPS=true
python -m uvicorn hypha.server:app --host=0.0.0.0 --port=9527
```

Alternatively, you can use our public testing server at [https://ai.imjoy.io](https://ai.imjoy.io).

## Serving Static Files

If you want to serve static files (e.g., HTML, JS, CSS) for your web applications, you can mount additional directories using the `--static-mounts` argument. This allows you to specify the mount path and the local directory.

To serve static files from the `./webtools/` directory at the path `/tools` on your server, use the following command:

```bash
python3 -m hypha.server --host=0.0.0.0 --port=9527 --static-mounts /tools:./webtools/
```

You can mount multiple directories by providing additional `--static-mounts` arguments. For example, to mount the `./images/` directory at `/images`, use the following command:

```bash
python3 -m hypha.server --host=0.0.0.0 --port=9527 --static-mounts /tools:./webtools/ /images:./images/
```

After running the command, you can access files from these directories via the Hypha server at `http://localhost:9527/tools` and `http://localhost:9527/images`, respectively.

## Connecting from a Client

Hypha provides native support for Python and JavaScript clients. For other languages, you can use the built-in HTTP proxy of Hypha (see details in a later section about "Login and Using Services from the HTTP proxy").

Ensure that the server is running, and you can connect to it using the `hypha` module under `hypha-rpc` in a client script. You can either register a service or use an existing service.

**WARNING: If you use hypha older than 0.15.x or lower, you will need to use `imjoy-rpc` instead of `hypha-rpc`.**

### Registering a Service

To register a service in Python, install the `hypha-rpc` library:

```bash
pip install hypha-rpc
```

The following code registers a service called "Hello World" with the ID "hello-world" and a function called `hello()`. The function takes a single argument, `name`, and prints "Hello" followed by the name. The function also returns a string containing "Hello" followed by the name.

We provide three versions of the code: an asynchronous version for native CPython or Pyodide-based Python in the browser (without thread support), a synchronous version for native Python with thread support (more details about the [synchronous wrapper](/hypha-rpc?id=synchronous-wrapper)), and a JavaScript version for web browsers:

<!-- tabs:start -->
#### ** Asynchronous Server **

```python
import asyncio
from hypha_rpc import connect_to_server

async def start_server(server_url):
    server = await connect_to_server({"server_url": server_url})
    
    def hello(name):
        print("Hello " + name)
        return "Hello " + name

    svc = await server.register_service({
        "name": "Hello World",
        "id": "hello-world",
        "config": {
            "visibility": "public"
        },
        "hello": hello
    })
    
    print(f"Hello world service registered at workspace: {server.config.workspace}, id: {svc.id}")

    print(f'You can use this service using the service id: {svc.id}')

    print(f"You can also test the service via the HTTP proxy: {server_url}/{server.config.workspace}/services/{svc.id.split('/')[1]}/hello?name=John")

    # Keep the server running
    await server.serve()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    server_url = "http://localhost:9527"
    asyncio.run(start_server(server_url))
```

#### ** Synchronous Server **

```python
from hypha_rpc.sync import connect_to_server

def start_server(server_url):
    server = connect_to_server({"server_url": server_url})
    
    def hello(name):
        print("Hello " + name)
        return "Hello " + name

    svc = server.register_service({
        "name": "Hello World",
        "id": "hello-world",
        "config": {
            "visibility": "public"
        },
        "hello": hello
    })
    
    print(f"Hello world service registered at workspace: {server.config.workspace}, id: {svc.id}")

    print(f'You can use this service using the service id: {svc.id}')

    print(f"You can also test the service via the HTTP proxy: {server_url}/{server.config.workspace}/services/{svc.id.split('/')[1]}/hello?name=John")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    server_url = "http://localhost:9527"
    start_server(server_url)
```

#### ** JavaScript Server **

First, install the `hypha-rpc` library:

```bash
npm install hypha-rpc
```

Or include it via CDN in your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hypha-rpc@0.20.54/dist/hypha-rpc-websocket.min.js"></script>
```

Then use the following JavaScript code to register a service:

```javascript
const serverUrl = "https://hypha.aicell.io"

const loginCallback = (context) => {
  window.open(context.login_url);
};

async function startServer(serverUrl) {
  // Log in and connect to the Hypha server
  const token = await hyphaWebsocketClient.login({
    server_url: serverUrl,
    login_callback: loginCallback,
  });

  const server = await hyphaWebsocketClient.connectToServer({
    server_url: serverUrl,
    token: token,
  });

  // Define a service method
  function hello(name, context) {
    console.log("Hello " + name);
    return "Hello " + name;
  }

  // Register the service with the server
  const myService = await server.registerService({
    id: "hello-world",
    name: "Hello World",
    description: "A simple hello world service",
    config: {
      visibility: "public",
      require_context: true,
    },
    hello: hello, // or just `hello,` in modern JS
  });

  console.log(`Hello world service registered at workspace: ${server.config.workspace}, id: ${myService.id}`);
  console.log(`You can use this service using the service id: ${myService.id}`);
  console.log(`You can also test the service via the HTTP proxy: ${serverUrl}/${server.config.workspace}/services/${myService.id.split('/')[1]}/hello?name=John`);
}

// Start the server
startServer(serverUrl);
```
<!-- tabs:end -->

Run the server script and keep it running. You can now access the service from a client script. You will see the service ID printed in the console, which you can use to access the service.

Tips: You don't need to run the client script on the same server. If you want to connect to the server from another computer, make sure to change the `server_url` to an URL with the external IP or domain name of the server.

**Note: The following sections assume that the server is running and the service is registered as service ID: `ws-user-scintillating-lawyer-94336986/YLNzuQvQHVqMAyDzmEpFgF:hello-world`, which you can replace with the actual service ID you obtained when registering the service.**

### Using the Service

If you keep the Python service running, you can connect to it from either a Python client or a JavaScript client on the same or a different host.

#### Python Client

Install the `hypha-rpc` library:

```bash
pip install hypha-rpc
```

Use the following code to connect to the server and access the service. The code first connects to the server and then gets the service by its ID. The service can then be used like a normal Python object.

Similarily, you can also use the `connect_to_server_sync` function to connect to the server synchronously.

<!-- tabs:start -->
#### ** Asynchronous Client **

```python
import asyncio
from hypha_rpc import connect_to_server

async def main():
    server = await connect_to_server({"server_url": "http://localhost:9527"})

    # Get an existing service
    # NOTE: You need to replace the service id with the actual id you obtained when registering the service
    svc = await server.get_service("ws-user-scintillating-lawyer-94336986/YLNzuQvQHVqMAyDzmEpFgF:hello-world")
    ret = await svc.hello("John")
    print(ret)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

#### ** Synchronous Client **

```python
import asyncio
from hypha_rpc.sync import connect_to_server

def main():
    server = connect_to_server({"server_url": "http://localhost:9527"})

    # Get an existing service
    # NOTE: You need to replace the service id with the actual id you obtained when registering the service
    svc = server.get_service("ws-user-scintillating-lawyer-94336986/YLNzuQvQHVqMAyDzmEpFgF:hello-world")
    ret = svc.hello("John")
    print(ret)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
<!-- tabs:end -->

**NOTE: In Python, the recommended way to interact with the server to use asynchronous functions with `asyncio`. However, if you need to use synchronous functions, you can use `from hypha_rpc.sync import login, connect_to_server` instead. The have the exact same arguments as the asynchronous versions. For more information, see [Synchronous Wrapper](/hypha-rpc?id=synchronous-wrapper)**


As a shortcut you can also use `get_remote_service`:
```python

from hypha_rpc import get_remote_service

# NOTE: You need to replace the service id with the actual id you obtained when registering the service
# The url format should be in the format: http://<server_url>/<workspace>/services/<client_id>:<service_id> (client_id is optional)
svc = await get_remote_service("http://localhost:9527/ws-user-scintillating-lawyer-94336986/services/YLNzuQvQHVqMAyDzmEpFgF:hello-world")
```

#### JavaScript Client

Include the following script in your HTML file to load the `hypha-rpc` client:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hypha-rpc@0.20.54/dist/hypha-rpc-websocket.min.js"></script>
```

Use the following code in JavaScript to connect to the server and access an existing service:

```javascript
async function main(){
    const server = await hyphaWebsocketClient.connectToServer({"server_url": "http://localhost:9527"})
    // NOTE: You need to replace the service id with the actual id you obtained when registering the service
    const svc = await server.getService("ws-user-scintillating-lawyer-94336986/YLNzuQvQHVqMAyDzmEpFgF:hello-world")
    const ret = await svc.hello("John")
    console.log(ret)
}
```

As a shortcut you can also use `hyphaWebsocketClient.getRemoteService`:

```javascript
// NOTE: You need to replace the service id with the actual id you obtained when registering the service
const svc = await hyphaWebsocketClient.getRemoteService("http://localhost:9527/ws-user-scintillating-lawyer-94336986/services/YLNzuQvQHVqMAyDzmEpFgF:hello-world")
const ret = await svc.hello("John")
console.log(ret)
```

### Peer-to-Peer Connection via WebRTC

By default all the clients connected to Hypha server communicate via the websocket connection or the HTTP proxy. This is suitable for most use cases which involves lightweight data exchange. However, if you need to transfer large data or perform real-time communication, you can use the WebRTC connection between clients. With hypha-rpc, you can easily create a WebRTC connection between two clients easily. See the [WebRTC support](/hypha-rpc?id=peer-to-peer-connection-via-webrtc) for more details.

### User Login and Token-Based Authentication

To access the full features of the Hypha server, users need to log in and obtain a token for authentication. The `login()` function provides a convenient way to display a login URL, once the user click it and login, it can then return the token for connecting to the server.

Here is an example of how the login process works using the `login()` function:

<!-- tabs:start -->
#### ** Asynchronous Client **

```python
from hypha_rpc import login, connect_to_server

token = await login({"server_url": "https://ai.imjoy.io"})
# A login URL will be printed to the console
# The user needs to open the URL in a browser and log in
# Once the user logs in, the login function will return
# with the token for connecting to the server
server = await connect_to_server({"server_url": "https://ai.imjoy.io", "token": token})
# ...use the server api...
```

#### ** Synchronous Client **

```python
from hypha_rpc.sync import login, connect_to_server

token = login({"server_url": "https://ai.imjoy.io"})
server = connect_to_server({"server_url": "https://ai.imjoy.io", "token": token})

# ...use the server api...
```
<!-- tabs:end -->

Login in javascript:
```javascript
async function main(){
    const token = await hyphaWebsocketClient.login({"server_url": "http://localhost:9527"})
    const server = await hyphaWebsocketClient.connectToServer({"server_url": "http://localhost:9527", "token": token})
    // ... use the server...
}
```

The output will provide a URL for the user to open in their browser and

 perform the login process. Once the user clicks the link and successfully logs in, the `login()` function will return, providing the token.

#### Additional Arguments for Login

You can specify the `workspace` and `expires_in` arguments in the `login()` function so that the token is generated for a specific workspace and expires after a certain period of time.

```python
token = await login(
    {
        "server_url": SERVER_URL,
        "workspace": "my-workspace",
        "expires_in": 3600,
    }
)
```

If a token is generated for a specific workspace, when calling `connect_to_server`, you need to specify the same workspace as well:

```python
server = await connect_to_server({"server_url": "https://ai.imjoy.io", "token": token, "workspace": "my-workspace"})
```

The `login()` function also supports other additional arguments:

```python
token = await login(
    {
        "server_url": SERVER_URL,
        "login_callback": login_callback,
        "login_timeout": 3,
    }
)
```

If no `login_callback` is passed, the login URL will be printed to the console. You can also pass a callback function as `login_callback` to perform custom actions during the login process.

For example, here is a callback function for displaying the login URL, or launching a browser for the user to login:

```python

async def callback(context):
    """
    Callback function for login.
    This function is used for display the login URL,
    Or launch the browser, display a QR code etc. for the user to login
    Once done, it should return;

    The context is a dictionary contains the following keys:
     - login_url: the login URL
     - report_url: the report URL
     - key: the key for the login
    """
    print(f"Go to login url: {context['login_url']}")
```

### User Authentication and Service Authorization

Hypha provide built-in support for user authentication, and based on the user context, you can also customize the service authorization within each service function.

In the previous example, we registered a public service (`config.visibility = "public"`) that can be accessed by any client. If you want to limit service access to a subset of clients, there are two ways to provide authorization.

1. Connecting to the Same Workspace: Set `config.visibility` to `"private"`. Authorization is achieved by generating a token from the client that registered the service (using `server.config.workspace` and `server.generate_token()`). Another client can connect to the same workspace using the token (`connect_to_server({"workspace": xxxx, "token": xxxx, "server_url": xxxx})`).

2. Using User Context: When registering a service, set `config.require_context` to `True` and `config.visibility` to `"public"` (or `"private"` to limit access for clients from the same workspace). Each service function needs to accept a keyword argument called `context`. The server will provide the context information containing `user` for each service function call. The service function can then check whether `context.user["id"]` is allowed to access the service. On the client side, you need to log in and generate a token by calling the `login({"server_url": xxxx})` function. The token is then used in `connect_to_server({"token": xxxx, "server_url": xxxx})`.

Here is an example for how to enable the user context in the service function:
```python

async def start_service(server):
    """Hypha startup function."""

    def test(x, context=None): # Note that the context argument is added
        current_user = context["user"]
        if current_user["email"] not in authorized_users:
            raise Exception(f"User {current_user['email']} is not authorized to access this service.")
        print(f"Test: {x}")

    # Register a test service
    await server.register_service(
        {
            "id": "test-service",
            "config": {
                "visibility": "public",
                "require_context": True, # enable user context
            },
            "test": test,
        }
    )
```

By default, hypha server uses a user authentication system based on [Auth0](https://auth0.com) controlled by us. You can also setup your own auth0 account to use it with your own hypha server. See [Setup Authentication](./setup-authentication) for more details.

### Login and Using Services from the HTTP proxy

#### Obtain login token via http requests
For clients other than Python or javascript (without hypha-rpc) support, you can use Hypha server's built-in HTTP proxy for services to obtain the token. Here is an example of how to obtain the token via HTTP requests:

First, let's initiate the login process by calling the `start` function of the `hypha-login` service:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://ai.imjoy.io/public/services/hypha-login/start" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
```
It will return something like:
```json
{"login_url":"https://ai.imjoy.io/public/apps/hypha-login/?key=mihDumpHGYxkPdSEKB7GgM","key":"mihDumpHGYxkPdSEKB7GgM","report_url":"https://ai.imjoy.io/public/services/hypha-login/report"}
```
Now you can print the `login_url` to the console or open it in a browser to login.

Immediately after displaying the url, you can call `check` to wait for the user to login and get the token, for example:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://ai.imjoy.io/public/services/hypha-login/check" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"key":"mihDumpHGYxkPdSEKB7GgM", "timeout": 10}'
```

For the above request:
 - replace `mihDumpHGYxkPdSEKB7GgM` with the actual key you obtained from the `start` function
 - and you can adjust the `timeout` to wait for the user to login, the above example will wait for 10 seconds.

This should wait and return the token if the user has successfully logged in, otherwise, it will return a timeout error.

For details, see the python implementation of the login function [here](https://github.com/imjoy-team/imjoy-rpc/blob/master/python/hypha_rpc/hypha/websocket_client.py#L175).

#### Using the Token in Service Requests

With the token, you can now request any protected service by passing the `token` as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` in the header, for example:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://ai.imjoy.io/public/services/hello-world/hello" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization : Bearer <token>" -d '{"name": "John"}'
```
For more details, see the service request api endpoint [here](https://ai.imjoy.io/api-docs#/default/service_function__workspace__services__service___keys__post).

### Service Probes

Probes are useful for monitoring the status of services. They can be used to check whether a service is running correctly or to retrieve information about the service. Probes are executed by the server and can be used to monitor the health of services.

We create a convenient shortcut to register probes for monitoring services. Here is an example of how to register a probe for a service:

```python
from hypha_rpc import connect_to_server

async def start_server(server_url):
    server = await connect_to_server({"server_url": server_url})

    # Assuming you have some services registered already
    # And you want to monitor the service status

    def check_readiness():
        # Check if the service is ready
        # Replace this with your own readiness check
        return {"status": "ok"}
    
    def check_liveness():
        # Check if the service is alive
        # Replace this with your own liveness check
        return {"status": "ok"}

    # Register probes for the service
    await server.register_probes({
        "readiness": check_readiness,
        "liveness": check_liveness,
    })

    # This will register probes service where you can accessed via hypha or the HTTP proxy
    print(f"Probes registered at workspace: {server.config.workspace}")
    print(f"Test it with the HTTP proxy: {server_url}/{server.config.workspace}/services/probes/readiness")

    # Keep the server running
    await server.serve()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    server_url = "https://my-hypha-server.org"
    asyncio.run(start_server(server_url))
```

For running the service as a worker in a kubernetes cluster, you can use the `liveness` probe to check if the service is alive and the `readiness` probe to check if the service is ready to serve requests.

The probes can be configured as follows:

```yaml

livenessProbe:
    exec:
        command:
        - /bin/sh
        - -c
        - curl -sf https://my-hypha-server.org/workspace/services/probes/liveness || exit 1
    initialDelaySeconds: 10
    periodSeconds: 5

readinessProbe:
    exec:
        command:
        - /bin/sh
        - -c
        - curl -sf https://my-hypha-server.org/workspace/services/probes/readiness || exit 1
    initialDelaySeconds: 10
    periodSeconds: 5
```

(Make sure to replace `https://my-hypha-server.org` with your actual hypha server URL)

### Custom Initialization and Service Integration with Hypha Server

Hypha's flexibility allows services to be registered from scripts running on the same host as the server or on a different one. To further accommodate complex applications, Hypha supports the initiation of "built-in" services in conjunction with server startup. This can be achieved using the `--startup-functions` option.

The `--startup-functions` option allows you to provide a URI pointing to a Python function intended for custom

 server initialization tasks. The specified function can perform various tasks, such as registering services, configuring the server, or launching additional processes. The URI should follow the format `<python module or script file>:<entrypoint function name>`, providing a straightforward way to customize your server's startup behavior.

For example, to start the server with a custom startup function, use the following command:

```bash
python -m hypha.server --host=0.0.0.0 --port=9527 --startup-functions=./example-startup-function.py:hypha_startup
```

Here's an example of `example-startup-function.py`:

```python
"""Example startup function file for Hypha."""

async def hypha_startup(server):
    """Hypha startup function."""

    def test(x):
        print(f"Test: {x}")

    # Register a test service
    await server.register_service(
        {
            "id": "test-service",
            "config": {
                "visibility": "public",
                "require_context": False,
            },
            "test": test,
        }
    )
```

Note that the startup function file will be loaded as a Python module. You can also specify an installed Python module by using the format `my_pip_module:hypha_startup`. In both cases, make sure to specify the entrypoint function name (`hypha_startup` in this case). The function should accept a single positional argument, `server`, which represents the server object used in the client script.

Multiple startup functions can be specified by providing additional `--startup-functions` arguments. For example, to specify two startup functions, use the following command:

```bash
python -m hypha.server --host=0.0.0.0 --port=9527 --startup-functions=./example-startup-function.py:hypha_startup ./example-startup-function2.py:hypha_startup
```
